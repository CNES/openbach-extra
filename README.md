OpenBACH
========

OpenBACH is a user-friendly and efficient benchmark to configure, supervise and control your network under test (e.g. terrestrial networks, satellite networks, WAN, LAN, etc.). It provides an efficient modular structure to facilitate the additions of new software tools, monitoring parameters, tasks, etc. The benchmark is able to be integrated in different types of equipments, servers, clients, hardware and software with minimal adaptation effort.

This platform has been promoted by CNES (French Space Center) as a reference open-source software tool within its research and development studies and activities in the domain of satellite network communications systems. OpenBACH has been developped in order to be complementary to OpenSAND, the satellite network emulator.
