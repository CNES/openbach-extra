# Executors

The executors  allow you to straightforward launch scenarios from CLI or import the JSON (thanks to auditorium-scripts API). Their name should begin with //executor_// (for example //executor_network_delay.py//). 

A simple usage of the executors is described in the [[openbach:manuals:2.x:user_manual:basic_user_cli:index|Simple Command Line Interface User Manual]].
