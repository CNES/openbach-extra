   * The Job opensand_conf will install the package opensand-daemon. When launched, it configures the opensand-daemon as the expected entity (ST, GW, SAT or NONE).
   * The Job opensand_run will install the package opensand-manager. When launched, it deploys and starts an OpenSAND scenario on the specified platform.
