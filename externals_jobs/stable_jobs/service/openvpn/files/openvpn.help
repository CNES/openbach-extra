Examples:
========
Example1: Set up a point to point VPN tunnel between a gateway GW and a satelitte terminal ST. 
          We consider that this tunnel is built above a satellite link which is emulated using OpenSAND SATCOM emulator.
          Also GW's subnet (192.168.42.0/24 with 192.168.42.1 as GW's IP address) and ST's subnet (192.168.1.0/24 with 192.168.1.1 as ST's IP address)
          communicate via VPN tunnel.


-In the OpenBACH controller web interface, create a scenario and add two start_job_instance function set as follows:
 For entity GW:
    local_ip = 192.168.42.1
    choose server mode
 For entity ST:
    local_ip = 192.168.1.1
    choose client mode
    server_ip = 192.168.42.1

-Or launch the job manually 
 from CLI of the GW agent as follows:
    sudo  python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/openvpn/openvpn.py 192.168.42.1 server
 from CLI of the ST agent as follows:
    sudo python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/openvpn/openvpn.py 192.168.1.1 client 192.168.42.1
