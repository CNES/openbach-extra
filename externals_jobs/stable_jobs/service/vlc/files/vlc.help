Examples:
========
Example1: From Agent "sender", stream default video (Big Buck Bunny) using vlc job to receiver agent's ip address 192.168.1.4 which will play received video during 50 seconds.  

-In the web interface, set the following parameters:
 For Agent "sender" running vlc job:
     dest_ip: 192.168.1.4
 For Agent "receiver" (Start 5s after sender is launched):
     recv_ip = 192.168.1.4
     duration = 50
     
-Or launch the job manually from the Agent as follows (the statistics will be available on the collector with a job_instance_id, scenario_instance_id and owner_scenario_instance_id of 0): 
    From sender CLI: JOB_NAME=vlc sudo -E -u openbach python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/vlc/vlc.py -dst_ip 192.168.1.4 
    From receiver CLI: JOB_NAME=vlc_receiver sudo -E -u openbach python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/vlc_receiver/vlc_receiver.py -recv_ip 192.168.1.4 -d 50
