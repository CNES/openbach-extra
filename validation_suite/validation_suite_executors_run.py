# It is composed of an Auditorium (HMIs), a Controller, a Collector
# and multiple Agents (one for each network entity that wants to be
# tested).

This script is part of the OpenBACH validation suite. 
This script can run all available executors - or a sub set of them
The available entities are :

|wss_admin_ip|    |midbox_admin_ip|    |wsc_admin_ip|    |ctrl_admin_ip|

+------------+    +---------------+    +------------+    +-------------+

Using parameters, the script has the following options:
    - all : all the available executors will be tested
    - network : all the executor_network_* will be tested
    - transport : all the executor_transport_* will be tested
    - service : all the executor_service_* will be tested
    - my-executor : the specified executor will be tested

Whatever the parameter, the script start by setting up the route between 
    wss <-> midbox <-> wsc
