# It is composed of an Auditorium (HMIs), a Controller, a Collector
# and multiple Agents (one for each network entity that wants to be
# tested).

#This script exploits the following auditorium scripts: 
#
#    list_project : 
#    	to list the project and see if the requested project is already created
#    delete_project : 
#    	to delete the project if previously already created
#    create_project : 
#    	to create the project
#    add_entity : 
#    	to add the entities to the project
#    install_jobs : 
#	to install the required jobs to the entities
