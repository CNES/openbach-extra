# OpenBACH is a generic testbed able to control/configure multiple
# network/physical entities (under test) and collect data from them.
# It is composed of an Auditorium (HMIs), a Controller, a Collector
# and multiple Agents (one for each network entity that wants to be
# tested).

"""Validation Suite

This module aims at being an exhaustive test of OpenBACH capabilities
to prevent regressions and help develop new features. Its role is to
run as much auditorium scripts has feasible and run a few scenarios
or executors.

The various tests will try to smartly understand the installed platform
it is run on to adequately select which tasks can be performed and on
which agent. The idea being to be unobtrusive in existing projects, this
means that on some platforms, agents can be already associated to a
project; so in order to get things tested, new machines can be associated
as agents for the time of the tests.
